For instance, driving is an everyday activity that people do to reach from point A to point B. This process has life-threatening risks, such as being in a severe accident which can occur at any point of driving. However, due to the benefit and convenience of driving, various rules and mitigations are implemented to reduce the apparent risk of accidents on the road. Similarly, different kinds of businesses also endure risks, which can happen in every step to gain maximal profit. Since risks are inevitable and are a natural process of achieving a goal, it is crucial to clearly identify and effectively manage them to avoid and reduce probable pitfalls ...............",
