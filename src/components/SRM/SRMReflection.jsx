complexities involving various risks at each step. For instance, driving is an everyday activity that people do to reach from point A to point B. This process has life-threatening risks, such as being in a severe accident which can occur at any point of driving. However, due to the benefit and convenience of driving, various rules and mitigations are implemented to reduce the apparent risk of accidents on the road. Similarly, different kinds of businesses also endure risks, which can happen in every step to gain maximal profit. Since risks are inevitable and are a natural process of achieving a goal, it is crucial to clearly identify and effectively manage them to avoid and reduce probable pitfalls. Security and Risk Management discusses the core concepts and methodologies of conducting risk management using different assessments, such as qualitative and quantitative analysis and methods to maintain business continuity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the beginning of the project, I guided the team to identify the risks of &lsquo;Pampered Pets&rsquo; by actively participating in brainstorming activities, discussion in the team, research, and documentation of the risks. As a software engineer currently in IT, the analytic mindset and programming skills have contributed to researching and analysing our tasks most efficiently using programming languages such as Python. My understanding of digital domains and their risks, such as cyber threats and business continuity strategies, and analysing the different risks and impacts of specific domains added value to our projects. Our team then researched different quantitative risk assessment methods. Most of these methods were not easy to understand without knowledge of Statistics/Mathematics, which would also make the analysing process more efficient. Here, applying different quantitative analysis methods in the programming language Python enabled the process to be faster and more efficient. Our analysis lies mainly on Monte Carlo for cyber risks and TOPSIS for supply chain risks, for which I wrote codes in Python to estimate the loss amount for the categorised risks. My other valuable contribution to the team was researching the different methods of disaster recovery for different requirements for RTO and RPO and implementing a strategy for &lsquo;Pampered Pets&rsquo; to achieve a highly available system for business continuity of the system. While carrying out such technical processes, it was inevitable to work individually. However, we tried to ensure good communication and collaboration in the team by dividing the tasks and creating regular meetings to avoid misunderstandings.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this module, our team analysed a brick-and-mortar company called &lsquo;Pampered Pets&rsquo;, wanting to expand its business through digitalisation and internationalisation. This analysis involved a critical evaluation of the company&rsquo;s infrastructure and its aims against potential risks which could create a possible setback to the corporation and its business continuity. In the process, two main types of risk management assessments were in focus: Qualitative analysis and Quantitative analysis. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Qualitative analysis allows businesses to quickly understand the risks by considering factors such as industry trends, expert recommendations on threats, and market condition risk based on subjective judgements rather than objective data. This analysis provides comprehensive quick decision-making methods, enhancing business adaptability. In the &lsquo;Pampered Pets&rsquo; analysis, different methods such as threat modelling, CVSS, OWASP Top Ten, and risk matrices were used to conduct qualitative analysis assessments to identify the risk and recommended mitigations. However, this method is based on expert opinion, making it incomplete as many risk categorisations are subjective, often using high, medium, and low-risk ratings (Ramona, S.E., 2011). Despite this, qualitative assessments are still suggested, as this method provides a quick way to identify risks as SMEs do not have enough skilled workforce or financial support to carry out an in-depth assessment. The qualitative method offers a practical and easy way to perform a risk assessment required for the company (Armenia S et al., 2021).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Contrary to Qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis is based on research data, which enables more objective risk decisions (Hall, H., 2023). In the case of &lsquo;Pampered Pets&rsquo;, quantitative analysis was also carried out to analyse supply chain risks and loss due to cyber threats. In the assessment, the particular side of understanding and applying different quantitative assessments like Monte Carlo, Bayesian networks for supply chain risk analysis (Badurdeen, F et al., 2014), AHP-TOPSIS (Menon, R.R, V. Ravi, 2022), and Open-fair (Freund, J. and Jones, J., 2015) seemed intriguing and most attractive. Based on the learnings from different sessions, our primary goal was to research and implement different quantitative methods to identify the risk loss based on data. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For this assessment, the Monte Carlo simulation was used to predict the loss due to cyber threats and AHP-TOPSIS was chosen to rank the suppliers given the identified risks. Monte Carlo simulation was chosen to assess the loss probability compared to other frameworks like Open Fair due to the simplicity of implementing it and saving resources which is usually an issue with SMEs like &lsquo;Pampered Pets&rsquo;. However, it must be noted that Monte Carlo depends on the statistical distribution chosen as the source of input variables. It could lead to false results if a non-matching probability distribution for the population is selected (Raychaudhuri, S., 2008). Nevertheless, Monte Carlo is recommended for SMEs, but the downsides must be considered. Similarly, AHP-TOPSIS was chosen as multiple studies were already conducted with this method to select a supplier (Sabaghi M et al., 2015). All these methods were deemed suitable for the assessment by looking at the size and resources available, which still provided an objective result to identify risks for the company.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used during this module, where unit 6 used qualitative and unit 11 assignment used quantitative assessment. The two methods are precious in assessing risks and preparing the business. Doing both would scrutinise and mitigate various possible risks properly. However, in case the resources and the budget for a company are restricted, the qualitative method is a must, and without it, the business will be in a very vulnerable state. Therefore, as a professional, I recommend any business carry out both methods and, with fewer resources, do qualitative analysis.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Engaging in these assessments with other colleagues as a team has brought many advantages. Working in a diverse field, from IT to business, our team learned from each other&rsquo;s experiences through collaborative decision-making and clear and concise communication with different areas of expertise and point of view. Handling and pitching essential and relevant ideas for obtaining precise results has been a challenge, but valuing and evaluating others&rsquo; opinions helped unblock many questions faster and more efficiently. In hindsight, teamwork has enriched personal and professional development aspects, i.e., enhanced decision-making, adaptability, holistic approach to problem-solving, and collaboration with different members to achieve a common goal. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">References</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Armenia, S., Angelini, M., Nonino, F., Palombi, G. and Schlitzer, M.F., 2021.
